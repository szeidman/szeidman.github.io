On a hike a few years ago a friend and I discussed documented attempts people have made to make things from scratch, such as a pencil or a toaster oven: though both are ubiquitous, it's very difficult to coordinate the supplies and assembly of each from top to bottom on one's own. Even so, and forgive me for bragging, I have access to both a toaster oven and *several* pencils in the comfort of my own home. I'm also pretty good at toasting things and putting graphite to paper, but I confess there are many things about toasting and penciling that are far beyond my skillset.

Learning to code is a confrontation with the layers above and below the specific levels at which you are currently programming. Many of them seem far below, like the flow of and storage of electricity on one's own computer or the initial machine and programming languages layered up to allow anything at all to even appear on a monitor. At some level one can digest the general concepts, but it is striking how each layer's development builds off the one below it and how much complexity there is in each one.

The "stack" in "fullstack" is one set of these layers. The early parts of my study mostly involved the Ruby language and how it works at a direct level, then progressed to frameworks and conventions on top of the language itself. These make the programming process more direct and streamlined but would be incomprehensible without first learning about the underlying concepts on which they are built.

Some of them allow communication with other languages like HTML and CSS to render websites or to SQL for managing data. Many, like ActiveRecord, Sinatra, and Rails are themselves made up of Ruby language and built with common programming tasks in mind. They anticipate what code a programmer would need to write from scratch and make it simpler for a programmer to generate the same code. 

These different levels of abstraction make it feasible to build and read code at the level needed. It is inconceivable that someone could look at, say, the raw binary data that goes into the generation of this blog post or build it from scratch (at least not without quite a bit of time on one's hands). It obviously helps to know how the underlying layers work, but it is also crucial to focus in on what needs to be done.

At the top of all of this comes the actual user interface, letting someone who has no idea how everything came together interact with all the underlying code in a meaningful way. Once the pencil is built, you only need to start writing.
