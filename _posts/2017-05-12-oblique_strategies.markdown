I left my job in February, without anything in particular lined up,  and started off on a long bicycle ride. A bit later, I got back home and started a coding course: I'd worked through a few free online tutorials before but, as with learning any languages, I figured it would be easier if I immersed myself in the work more frequently. Many of the lessons so far have been reviews of concepts I have covered before, but often with new approaches or twists built in, and so the teaching steadily pushes forward my understanding of even things I thought I already knew. Of course, there has also been quite a bit of new information to digest on top of that. It is fascinating to slowly realize how the different components of the curriculum fit together into the creation of a final product. I look forward to seeing what I am able to build next.
